	abstract = {Visibility is the degree to which different parts of the environment can be observed from a given vantage point. In the absence of previous familiarity or signage, the visibility of key elements in a multilevel environment (e.g., the entrance, exit, or the destination itself) becomes a primary input to make wayfinding decisions and avoid getting lost. Previous research has focused on memory-based wayfinding and mental representation of 3D space, but few studies have investigated the direct effects of visibility on wayfinding. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have explicitly observed the interaction between visibility and wayfinding under uncertainty in a multilevel environment. To bridge this gap, we studied how the visibility of destinations, as well as the continuity of sight-lines along the vertical dimension, affects unaided and goal-directed wayfinding behavior in a multilevel desktop Virtual Reality (VR) study. We obtained results from a total of 69 participants. Each participant performed a total of 24 wayfinding trials in a multilevel environment. Results showcase a significant and nonlinear correlation between the visibility of destinations and wayfinding behavioral characteristics. Specifically, once the destination was in sight, regardless of whether it was highly or barely visible, participants made an instantaneous decision to switch floors and move up towards the destination. In contrast, if the destination was out-of-sight, participants performed ‘visual exploration’, indicated by an increase in vertical head movements and greater time taken to switch floors. To demonstrate the direct applicability of this fundamental wayfinding behavioral pattern, we formalize these results by modeling a visibility-based cognitive agent. Our results show that by modeling the transition between exploration and exploitation as a function of visibility, cognitive agents were able to replicate human wayfinding patterns observed in the desktop VR study. This simple demonstration shows the potential of extending our main findings concerning the nonlinear relationship between visibility and wayfinding to inform the modeling of human cognition.},

These differences, however, are poorly understood and can be difficult to assess except by self-report methods. VEs offer an opportunity to collect objective data in environments that can be controlled and standardized. In this study, we designed a VE consisting of buildings arrayed along 2 separated routes, allowing for differentiation of between-route and within-route representation. Performance on a pointing task and a model-building task correlated with self-reported navigation ability. However, for participants with lower levels of between-route pointing, the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction scale (Hegarty, Richardson, Montello, Lovelace, {\textbackslash}\& Subbiah, 2002) did not predict individual differences in accuracy when pointing to buildings within the same route. Thus, we confirm the existence of individual differences in the ability to construct a cognitive map of an environment, identify both the strengths and the potential weaknesses of self-report measures, and isolate a dimension that may help to characterize individual differences more completely. The VE designed for this study provides an objective behavioral measure of navigation ability that can be widely used as a research tool.},

	abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) technology has become a popular method for fundamental and applied spatial cognition research. One challenge researchers face is emulating walking in a large-scale virtual space although the user is in fact in a small physical space. To address this, a variety of movement interfaces in VR have been proposed, from traditional joysticks to teleportation and omnidirectional treadmills. These movement methods tap into different mental processes of spatial learning during navigation, but their impacts on distance perception remain unclear. In this paper, we investigated the role of visual display, proprioception, and optic flow on distance perception in a large-scale building by manipulating four different movement methods. Eighty participants either walked in a real building, or moved through its virtual replica using one of three movement methods: VR-treadmill, VR-touchpad, and VR-teleportation. Results revealed that, first, visual display played a major role in both perceived and traversed distance estimates but did not impact environmental distance estimates. Second, proprioception and optic flow did not impact the overall accuracy of distance perception, but having only an intermittent optic flow (in the VR-teleportation movement method) impaired the precision of traversed distance estimates. In conclusion, movement method plays a significant role in distance perception but does not impact the configurational knowledge learned in a large-scale real and virtual building, and the VR-touchpad movement method provides an effective interface for navigation in VR.},

We conducted an empirical study with human subjects in a complex multi-level building and compared thinking aloud protocols and performance measures of experienced and inexperienced participants in different wayﬁnding tasks. Three speciﬁc strategies for navigation in multilevel buildings were compared. The central point strategy relies on well-known parts of the building; the direction strategy relies on routes that ﬁrst head towards the horizontal position of the goal, while the ﬂoor strategy relies on routes that ﬁrst head towards the vertical position of the goal. We show that the ﬂoor strategy was preferred by experienced participants over the other strategies and was overall tied to better wayﬁnding performance. Route knowledge showed a greater impact on wayﬁnding performance compared to survey knowledge. A cognitive-architectural analysis of the building revealed seven possible causes for navigation problems. Especially the staircase design was identiﬁed as a major wayﬁnding obstacle. Finally we address the beneﬁts of cognitive approaches for the architectural design process and describe some open issues for further research.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

The application of traditional analytic methods to the data from such studies can result in serious bias in testing experimental effects. In this review, we develop a comprehensive typology of designs involving two random factors, which may be either crossed or nested, and one ﬁxed factor, condition. We present appropriate linear mixed models for all designs and develop effect size measures. We provide the tools for power estimation for all designs. We then discuss issues of design choice, highlighting power and feasibility considerations.

However, the evaluation of sketch maps is challenging as they differ in many aspects and can be scored on many possible criteria. In particular, the classification of sketch maps into different types can be problematic, because participants rarely follow any of the identifiable formats consistently. This paper presents a set of criteria that can be used to score a sketch map on two dimensions simultaneously: its “route-likeness” and its “survey-likeness”. The scoring is based on the presence or absence of six features for route-conveying information and six features of conveying survey information. In the present study, reliability estimates and factor structure of the approach were examined with 460 sketch maps with a high variability of spatial elements included. Results show that the two dimensions are largely independent. Sketch maps are found that score high on the route dimensions but low on the survey dimension and vice versa, as well as sketch maps that score high (or low) on both dimensions. It is concluded that the proposed two-dimensional scoring is useful for analysing sketch maps, however, results will also depend on the task and instruction when assessing participants’ knowledge of spatial environments.},

It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.

By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.

The notion of “main sequences” was introduced as a potential explanation for the extensive parallelisms identified among ontogenesis, microgenesis, the course of pathology, and the recovery of function following pathological insult.

The stackedfloor buildings used in previous studies may limit people’s ability to integrate floors into a volumetric mental map. In this study, we assessed wayfinding and cognitive performances of 31 participants in a multilevel shopping mall with five atriums which provided adequate visual access and smooth floor transitions. (1) In the wayfinding task, we observed path choice for 31 participants in this mall. The participants’ choice for all path segments, also vertical path segments, clearly gravitated toward the most accessible spaces in the whole building, rather than most accessible space within individual floors. (2) Participants were also asked to identify the locations where they can see maximum number of stores. The identified locations can be reliably predicted by objectively measured three-dimensional visibility information, but not two-dimensional visibility information. (3) In the pointing task, participants can accurately point to out-of-sight targets in the same floor and in the different floor, in both azimuth and elevation direction. In sum, those findings suggest that people can memorize a multilevel atrium building as a volumetric map. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of developing three-dimensional configurational variables to explain human spatial behavior and spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {Since its invention by Francis Galton in 1877 regression analysis has been found useful in almost all disciplines. Comparison of geographic phenomena requires a two-dimensional extension of this technique. In this manner geographic maps can be compared with each other. Possible applications include geometric comparison of ancient and modern maps, or of “mental” maps, or for rubber-sheeting as used in Geographic Information Systems and in remote sensing. Other applications, for example, in biology for the comparison of shapes of leaves, fish, faces, or skulls after the manner of D'Arcy W. Thompson are also possible, as are higher-dimensional and multivariate cases. The method implements, and puts into this new context, existing models from the field of cartography. The linear case yields an easy definition of a Pearsonian-like correlation coefficient. The bidimensional case is richer in mathematical options than is the usual unidimensional version. The curvilinear case is of even greater utility. Here the regression coefficients constitute a spatially varying, but coordinate invariant, second-order tensor field defined by the matrix of partial derivatives of the transformation. This can be shown to be essentially equivalent to Tissot's Indicatrix, used in cartography to determine the properties of a map projection. In a computer implementation a nonparametric approach allows visualization of the regression by automatically plotting the pair of scatter diagrams, drawing of the displacement field, differentiable smooth interpolation of the warped coordinates and predicted image, by a diagram of the principal strains, and with contour maps of the estimated local angular, areal, and total distortion.},

This code is centered on the hippocampal place cells, which are active in particular places in the environment. Place cells are informed by numerous other spatial cell types including grid cells, which provide a signal for distance and direction and are thought to help anchor the place cell signal. These neurons combine self-motion and environmental information to create and update their map-like representation. Study of their activity patterns in complex environments of varying structure has revealed that this "cognitive map" of space is not a fixed and rigid entity that permeates space, but rather is variably affected by the movement constraints of the environment. These findings are pointing toward a more flexible spatial code in which the map is adapted to the movement possibilities of the space. An as-yet-unanswered question is whether these different forms of representation have functional consequences, as suggested by an enactivist view of spatial cognition.},

Environmental spatial tasks, such as wayfinding or learning the layout of a building or city, are carried out in larger spaces that surround the body and involve integration of the sequence of views that change with one’s movement in the environment. In a correlational study, 221 participants were tested on psychometric measures of spatial abilities, spatial updating, verbal abilities and working memory. They also learned the layout of large environments from direct experience walking through a real environment, and via two different media: a desktop virtual environment (VE) and a videotape of a walk through an environment. In an exploratory factor analysis, measures of environmental learning from direct experience defined a separate factor from measures of learning based on VE and video media. In structural-equation models, smallscale spatial abilities predicted performance on the environmental-learning tasks, but were more predictive of learning from media than from direct experience. The results indicate that spatial abilities at different scales of space are partially but not totally dissociated. They specify the degree of overlap between small-scale and large-scale spatial abilities, inform theories of sex differences in these abilities, and provide new insights about what these abilities have in common and how they differ.},

	abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers possibilities of creating a learner-centric environment that can provide more presence and engagement for students leading to an enhanced learning experience compared to conventional classroom practices. However, the potential of IVR in vocational education and training (VET) has not yet been explored in-depth, and it is an open question of whether it can effectively support learner creation in a designing task. In this paper, we present an IVR application developed to support gardener apprentices in designing gardens. Using this application, we conducted an experimental study with gardener apprentices to investigate the effect of the IVR interface compared to paper sketching and learner behavior on the proportion, composition, and creativity of the design outcome. Additionally, we investigated how it can be combined with a paper sketching activity to improve its effectiveness. Our analysis shows that the IVR interface can be more effective for the proportion aspect, but this may be limited to students that are able to use it after working with paper. In terms of the combination order, the effectiveness of IVR on the design quality was improved when it was carried out after the paper sketching and this ordering produced a more effective outcome for the proportion and composition aspects. Finally, our results show that IVR design quality is related to learner behaviors such as the time spent on designing and the number of simulations used. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of IVR applications in supporting designing skills and how effectiveness can be improved by combining it with a conventional method of practice. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic The effectiveness of IVR has been reported in a variety of educational settings. IVR enhances learning through situated experience, multiple perspectives, and simulations that transfer to the real world. Most IVR applications for VET have focused on passive learning or basic procedural skills. What this paper adds Design and implementation of an IVR application in VET to support design-related learning. The use of IVR may have a significant impact on the quality of design outcomes. The use of IVR after paper sketching may increase the quality of designs during IVR use. Implications for practice and/or policy IVR can enhance the design outcome in terms of the proportion aspect, but this may be limited to students that are able to use it after working with paper. The design quality can be affected by the combination order between IVR and paper sketching where the effectiveness of IVR can be improved when it is carried out after paper sketching. The behavior of learners while using IVR can be used as indicators of the design quality.},

	abstract = {Context: Exploring the design space is an important process in a design task. In this study, we considered design space exploration for the learners in vocational education and training (VET). The goal of the study was to investigate how they explore the design space while focusing on the effect of a graph-like interface on the learner’s understanding of the design space. With florists as the target profession, we investigated how the apprentices explore design variations, what they would gain from such activity, and how we can support this process.  Approach: We developed a web application called BloomGraph that allows learners to explore design variations. It provides a graph-based interface that enables the systematic variation of design. Using the BloomGraph application, we conducted an experimental study with 44 florist apprentices in Switzerland to investigate the effect of the graph-based interface which provides a structured way of exploring the design space. The experimental group was given the graph-based interface to explore design variations while the control group had a linear-based interface. We compared them in terms of the number of bouquets explored, time of exploration, diversity of bouquets explored, and the learning gain in terms of the understanding of the design space measured using pre and post-tests. We also analyzed the strategies adopted by the participants for the graph navigation and the visual exploration behavior using the eye gaze data.   Findings: Our analysis shows that the graph-based interface fosters a better understanding of the size of the design space and more efficient navigation towards a goal design in terms of the number of intermediate designs but with longer exploration of each intermediate design compared to the linear-based interface. Regarding the behavioral patterns in graph exploration, the participants who showed more strategic behavior in the design choices acquired a better understanding of the design space. Additionally, we trained a model that predicts the next choice of a learner using eye tracking data. It provides a reasonable accuracy that opens new possibilities for future studies. Conclusion: The findings of this study support the feasibility of design space exploration as a digital activity for VET learners and show how the learners can benefit from it. The contribution of the paper includes the validation of the idea with florist apprentices and the demonstration of how the process can be supported using a structured interface and the learner behavior analysis. This paper shows how a design exploration activity can provide an added value in the learning of an apprentice in a design-related VET system. (DIPF/Orig.)},

According to the theory, when people learn the locations of objects in a new environment, they interpret the spatial structure of that environment in terms of a spatial reference system. Our current conjecture is that a reference system intrinsic to the collection of objects is used. Intrinsic axes or directions are selected using egocentric (e.g., viewing perspective) and environmental (e.g., walls of the surrounding room) cues. The dominant cue is egocentric experience. The reference system selected at the first view is typically not updated with additional views or observer movement. However, if the first view is misaligned but a subsequent view is aligned with natural and salient axes in the environment, a new reference system is selected and the layout is reinterpreted in terms of this new reference system. The chapter also reviews evidence on the orientation dependence of spatial memories and recent results indicating that two representations may be formed when people learn a new environment; one preserves interobject spatial relations and the other comprises visual memories of experienced views.},

Additionally, the theory points out the unique role of vista spaces and asymmetries in spatial memory. New predictions are derived from the theory, one of which has been tested recently.},

	abstract = {It is commonly recognized that free-hand sketch maps are influenced by cognitive impacts and therefore sketch maps are incomplete, distorted, and schematized. This makes it difficult to achieve a one-to-one alignment between a sketch map and its corresponding geo-referenced metric map. Nevertheless, sketch maps are still useful to communicate spatial knowledge, indicating that sketch maps contain certain spatial information that is robust to cognitive impacts. In existing studies, sketch maps are used frequently to measure cognitive maps. However, little work has been done on invariant spatial information in sketch maps, which is the information of spatial configurations representing correctly the real world. We aim to study such information from a cognitive perspective. This paper first presents basic spatial objects identified in sketch maps and then introduces sketch aspects that capture invariant spatial information. The accuracy and reliability of these aspects were evaluated by a human study. We collected sketch maps from participants, extracted and measured spatial relations of identified spatial objects, and in the end analyzed the accuracy and statistical significance of these relations. Based on the statistical survey, we propose in this paper a set of seven sketch aspects that constitute invariant spatial information, along with a spatial analysis method to measure them. The findings of these aspects help to understand which spatial information is preserved under the transformation from the physical world to human sketch maps.},

	abstract = {Humans and other animals build up spatial knowledge of the environment on the basis of visual information and path integration. We compare three hypotheses about the geometry of this knowledge of navigation space: (a) ‘cognitive map’ with metric Euclidean structure and a consistent coordinate system, (b) ‘topological graph’ or network of paths between places, and (c) ‘labelled graph’ incorporating local metric information about path lengths and junction angles. In two experiments, participants walked in a non-Euclidean environment, a virtual hedge maze containing two ‘wormholes’ that visually rotated and teleported them between locations. During training, they learned the metric locations of eight target objects from a ‘home’ location, which were visible individually. During testing, shorter wormhole routes to a target were preferred, and novel shortcuts were directional, contrary to the topological hypothesis. Shortcuts were strongly biased by the wormholes, with mean constant errors of 37° and 41° (45° expected), revealing violations of the metric postulates in spatial knowledge. In addition, shortcuts to targets near wormholes shifted relative to flanking targets, revealing ‘rips’ (86\% of cases), 'folds' (91\%), and ordinal reversals (66\%) in spatial knowledge. Moreover, participants were completely unaware of these geometric inconsistencies, reflecting a surprising insensitivity to Euclidean structure. The probability of the shortcut data under the Euclidean map model and labelled graph model indicated decisive support for the latter (BFGM{\textgreater}100). We conclude that knowledge of navigation space is best characterized by a labelled graph, in which local metric information is approximate, geometrically inconsistent, and not embedded in a common coordinate system. This class of ‘cognitive graph’ models supports route finding, novel detours, and rough shortcuts, and has the potential to unify a range of data on spatial navigation.},

The current study investigated whether humans’ localization is more variable vertically than horizontally in different locomotion modes. In an immersive virtual room, participants learned the locations of objects presented on one wall. By locomoting from a location on the floor to each object, they replaced objects using memories. One group of participants (the flying group) flew three-dimensionally along their viewing direction by pushing a joystick. The second group (floor-wall group) locomoted only on the floor and the wall along the projection of the viewing direction onto the current travelling surface. The third group pressed a button to be teleported from the floor to the wall and then locomoted on the wall (wall-only group). The results showed that the variance of localization error was larger vertically than horizontally in the flying and floor-wall groups but that the pattern reversed in the wall-only group. In addition, while both the flying and wall-only groups locomoted straight towards the target location, the floor-wall group locomoted straight towards the projection of the target location onto the ground rather than straight towards the wall, indicating that the floor-wall group tried to avoid horizontal movement on the wall. These results suggest that for humans a horizontal advantage occurs in encoding the objects’ locations presented on the wall whereas a vertical advantage occurs in locomotion on the wall.},

A total of 142 college students in Korea and the U.S. engaged in the final stage of the development process—the validity and reliability check—by taking both the AISAT and two general spatial ability tests. The results from the split-half correlation and internal consistency showed that the AISAT reached a desirable level of reliability. Face, content, concurrent, and convergent validity were achieved to verify the AISAT. The authors hope that the AISAT will be used to measure domain-specific spatial ability, ultimately expanding our understanding of the role of spatial ability in spatial design thinking and performance. The AISAT has the potential to benefit (1) researchers who seek a credible tool to assess design students' spatial ability, (2) educators investigating the effect of their intervention in spatial design performance in relation to spatial ability, and (3) researchers in spatial ability who would like to extend their interest in spatial design beyond the traditional psychometric approach.},

In a cross sectional study, master students (N = 91) outperformed beginners (N = 502) on two novel tests involving perspective taking and object composition, as well as on a standardized visualization of cross-sections test, but not on a standardized mental rotations test. Longitudinally (N = 117), spatial performance improved after the first bachelor year on visualization of cross-sections, object composition and mental rotation. Although both genders showed higher spatial test performance with increased experience, male students outperformed females across tests and levels of education. The results overall confirmed improvements in spatial performance during architecture studies, with partial support for the domain-specificity hypothesis. A gender gap among advanced students calls for further examining architecture-specific spatial thinking.},

In addition, the mismatch of reported male outperformance on general spatial ability tasks and absence of gender difference in design performance prompt questioning on whether interior design requires a specific type of spatial ability that general spatial ability tests may not sufficiently measure. Thus, the purpose of this study was to understand the details of spatial ability and their relationship with students’ interior design performance. In order to clarify the particular spatial proficiency required for interior design, the following test tools were used: (1) general spatial ability tests and (2) the Architecture and Interior design domain-specific Spatial Ability Test (AISAT), developed for this study. The spatial ability scores of 40 interior design majors at one university in South Korea were compared with the scores they received from three experts on design projects they completed. Results show that (1) 2D-to-3D visualization proficiency on the AISAT correlated with both the originality and three-dimensional quality of the design product, (2) 2D-to-3D visualization proficiency predicted both the originality and 3D quality of the design product, and (3) male outperformance was found only in general spatial ability. Results highlight the necessity to nurture 2D-to-3D visualization proficiency for the improvement of design performance in interior design education.},

However, 3D applications of isovist analysis simply extrapolate the assumptions of its 2D counterpart, without questioning whether these assumptions remain valid in 3D. They do not: because human perception is embodied, the perception of vertical space differs from the perception of horizontal space. We present a user study demonstrating that an embodied 3D isovist that accounts for this phenomenon (formalised based on the notion of spatial artefacts) predicts human perception of space more accurately than the generic volumetric 3D isovist, specifically with respect to spaciousness and complexity. We suggest that the embodied 3D isovist should be used for 3D analyses in which human perception is of key interest.},

	abstract = {Sketch maps are one of the most commonly used instruments to study people's perception of the environment. While previous research has focused on analyzing sketch maps with respect to their accuracy, completeness, or distortion, there is little study focusing on generalization (the level of geometric details of the depicted features) in sketch maps. Furthermore, when investigating people's mental representations of space, researchers compute the accuracy or completeness of sketch maps via a one-to-one comparison of sketched features with features in metric map data. The task of one-to-one comparison becomes problematic because features in sketch map often represent many features in a metric map. This paper identifies the frequently occurring generalizations in 108 sketch maps of small urban area by manually extracting generalized features such as streets and buildings and classifying them based on similarities. We found three generalization types in streets, two in junctions and four in buildings. To evaluate our classification, we created 10 sketch maps by systematically introducing the nine identified generalizations. A study was conducted wherein five raters were briefed about the different generalization types. Each of them classified the features in sketch maps as generalized and non-generalized. We found a high inter-rater agreement, implying the comprehensibility and clarity of the identified generalization types. We propose that such systematic view on the generalization in sketch maps would standardize the process of comparing them with metric map data as well as enable a new way of analyzing sketch maps with respect to generalization.},

Existing evaluations identified in the survey are organized and discussed within three high-level categories: 1) evaluating the 3D sketching activity, 2) evaluating 3D sketching tools, and 3) evaluating 3D sketching artifacts. The new framework suggests targeting evaluations to one or more of these categories and identifying relevant user populations. In addition, building upon the discussion of the different phases of the 3D sketching process, the framework suggests to evaluate relevant sketching tasks, which may range from low-level perception and hand movements to high-level conceptual design. Finally, we discuss limitations and challenges that arise when evaluating 3D sketching, including a lack of standardization of evaluation methods and multiple, potentially conflicting, ways to evaluate the same task and user interface usability; we also identify opportunities for more holistic evaluations.

	abstract = {An intuitive way to externalize spatial memory is to sketch it. Compared to traditional paper-based sketches, virtual reality (VR) creates new opportunities to investigate the 3D aspect of spatial memory as it empowers users to express 3D information on a 3D interface directly. The goal of this study is to design a 3D sketch mapping tool for researchers and non-expert users without sketching expertise that enables externalizing memories of spatial information after some 3D-critical tasks. There exist 3D sketching tools using VR, but there are two issues with the current mid-air 3D sketching approach: (1) distortion of sketches due to depth perception errors and (2) increased cognitive and sensorimotor demands due to an increased degree of freedom and absence of physical support. To address these problems, we implemented VResin, a novel sketching interface that synergizes 3D mid-air sketching with 2D surface sketching to scaffold 3D sketching into a layer-by-layer process. An experimental study with 48 participants on multi-layer building scenarios showed that VResin supports users in creating less distorted sketches while maintaining the level of completeness and generalization compared to mid-air sketching in VR. We also demonstrate the potential applications that can benefit from 3D sketch maps and the suitability of VResin for a variety of building shapes.},

In Study 2, an egocentric spatial updating strategy scale was designed as part of a new self-report Navigation Strategy Questionnaire (NSQ), and validated with regards to relevant behavioral measures of spatial and landmark knowledge. Notably, egocentric-survey map sketchers reported the highest scores on this new scale among three groups of map sketchers, supporting the proposal that they were highly involved in egocentric spatial processing during route learning.},

Design study 2 explores animating artist-created visualization designs with scientific 3D fluid flow data. While results captured an accurate sense of flow that was advantageous as compared to the results of study 1, the potential for visual exploration using the design tools tested was limited. Design study 3 reveals the importance of a new 3D interface that overcomes the precision limitation found in study 1 while remaining accessible to artist collaborators. Drawing upon previous results, design study 4 engages collaborative teams in a design process that begins with traditional paper sketching and moves to animated interactive VR prototypes "sketched" by designers in VR using interactive 3D tools. Conclusions from these four studies identify important characteristics of effective artist-accessible VR visualization design tools and lead to a proposed formalized methodology for successful collaborative design that we expect to be useful in guiding future collaborations.

The potential of such systems is estimated in the possibility to create models in a one-to-one scale, to interact with product models and to reduce breaks between analogue and digital media during the development process [DBWB*00; IWMS09]. Despite the growing interest in 3D-sketching techniques, little is known so far about the ability of designers to create free-hand drawings in three-dimensional space. In particular, only few studies have investigated cognitive and sensorimotor processes during immersive sketching yet. This paper contributes to the research on immersive sketching by investigating the learnability of free-hand sketching in an experimental setting. In a study among 25 students, participants repeatedly sketched primitive shapes (circles, squares, balls, and cubes). Sketching performance was operationalized by the time needed to complete a sketch, the quality of the sketch, and the subjective mental workload of the designers. Results suggest a significant enhancement of sketching quality over time, but no change in the time needed to complete a sketch.},

This paper reports on the development of SPACE and presents the results from three usability studies across different ages. Study 1 compared the traditional tap and swipe control interface with a semiautomated interface. Study 2 investigated the benefits of a UI widget that displayed the rotation performed in the Virtual Environment (VE). Study 3 evaluated the effects of a simplified configuration of landmarks explored in the VE. Findings across the studies indicated that age was the primary factor influencing performance. Younger participants consistently outperformed older ones across various tasks and reported higher usability and lower workload. Despite notable performance improvements for the tasks in SPACE, the new control interface, UI widget, and simplified configuration only had a minimal impact on usability. Younger participants rated SPACE above the level of mature products, while older participants found it useable but not always engaging. Critically, the significant interactions between age and experimental conditions indicated that younger and older participants benefited differently from the design modifications. Here, the semi-automated control, the simplified configuration, and, to a lesser extent, the UI widget showed promise in mitigating age-related performance differences while maintaining the level of challenge necessary to assess differences in cognitive status. This research showcases the potential of SPACE as a serious game and emphasises the importance of balancing simplicity with task demands for future unsupervised deployment.},

Sketch2Terrain empowers non-experts to create unambiguous sketch maps of natural environments and provides a homogeneous interface for researchers to collect data and conduct experiments. A between-subject study (N=36) revealed that generative-3D-sketch-mapping improved efficiency by 38.4\%, terrain-topology accuracy by 12.5\%, and landmark accuracy by up to 12.1\%, with only a 4.7\% trade-off in terrain-elevation accuracy compared to freehand 3D-sketch-mapping. Additionally, generative-3D-sketch-mapping reduced perceived strain by 60.5\% and stress by 39.5\% over 2D-sketch-mapping. These findings underscore potential applications of generative-3D-sketch-mapping for in-depth understanding and accurate representation of vertically complex environments.

To assess the properties of these cognitive maps, sketch mapping has been widely used as a research tool in spatial cognition research. This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodologies and the cognitive processes concerning the externalization of cognitive maps through sketch mapping. Following the PRISMA-ScR checklist (Tricco et al. in Ann Intern Med 169(7):467–473, 2018, https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-0850), a comprehensive search from five electronic databases was performed with predefined combinations of keywords. Twenty-four articles were selected and analyzed, covering a wide range of methods: traditional pen-and-paper sketching (n = 18 studies); combination of pen-and-paper and digital sketching (n = 1); exclusively digital sketching (n = 4); and digital VR sketching (n = 1). With regard to the formation of cognitive maps in environmental scale spaces, studies employed either direct experience or virtual experience of unfamiliar environments, videos, maps, or retrieval from own memory. This review highlights the inherent conflict between sketch maps’ advantages in capturing knowledge in less structured experimental protocols and researchers’ need for structured quantification of their quality, as well as the underused diversity of media through which sketch maps can be produced for appropriate scenarios. We encourage researchers to (a) increase the precision in reporting the cognitive processes being investigated with sketch maps (e.g., short-term vs. long-term memory), (b) rely on established data analysis methods instead of developing custom measures for each study, and (c) consider alternative media beyond pen and paper when more suitable to the experimental context.},

However, little research has been conducted on the differences in the visual and spatial processes involved in 3D versus 2D sketching and their effects on cognition. This study investigated potential differences in spatial and visual functions related to the use of 3D versus 2D sketching media by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We recruited 20 healthy, right-handed students from the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture with at least three years of experience in freehand landscape drawing. Using an Oculus Quest VR headset controller and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, we tested participants individually with 3D and 2D sketching, respectively. When comparing 2D and 3D sketches, our fMRI results revealed significant differences in the activation of several brain regions, including the right middle temporal gyrus, both sides of the parietal lobe, and the left middle occipital gyrus. We also compared different sketching conditions, such as lines, geometrical objects (cube), and naturalistic objects (perspective view of a tree), and found significant differences in the spatial and visual recognition of brain areas that support visual recognition, composition, and spatial perception. This finding suggests that 3D sketching environments, such as VR, may activate more visual–spatial functions during sketching compared to 2D environments. The result highlights the potential of immersive sketching environments for design-related processes and spatial thinking.},

	abstract = {Drawing a picture of the referent of a word produces considerably better recall and recognition of that word than does a baseline condition, such as repeatedly writing the word, a phenomenon referred to as the drawing effect. Although the drawing effect has been the focus of much recent research, it is not yet clear what underlies the beneficial effects of drawing to memory. In 3 experiments, we explored the roles of item and order information following drawing versus silent reading and produced 2 important findings. First, the drawing effect in recall was substantially larger when the 2 conditions were intermixed in a single list compared to appearing in separate lists-in other words, drawing produced a design effect. Second, the studied order was better retained for silent reading compared to drawing in pure lists. These findings are consistent with the item-order account: Memory for the order of drawn lists is poorer because the elaborative act of drawing disrupts the encoding of interitem associations (i.e., relational information) between all list items. Thus, the selection of an encoding task should be informed by how that memory might be used in the future; if one wants to remember individual items, then an elaborative task such as drawing is recommended; if one wants to remember their sequence, it is likely better to read silently.

	abstract = {The objective evaluation of empirical studies is an important part when assessing demand and validating design methods. However, metrics that can also map cognitive processes during design are still lacking. In order to address this problem, an online study with 12 participants was conducted. The aim of this investigation was to find a relation between cognitive load and performance in engineering design tasks. To assess the cognitive load, the NASA-RTLX questionnaire was used as an established measurement tool and was related to the results achieved by the participants. The results show that there is a correlation between the two investigated parameters. Based on a statistical analysis a correlation between increasing cognitive load and a decrease in performance could be identified. The tasks used produce comparable results to other studies investigating cognitive load, but the task causing the highest cognitive load shows the widest scatter in performance. The u-curve as suggested by the state of the art was not visible in the study’s results, but the cognitive load should be nevertheless used for studies of design processes, because it may reveal a need for methodical support.},

	abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines commonly illustrate 3D relationships in diagrams, yet these are often challenging for students. Failing to understand diagrams can hinder success in STEM because scientific practice requires understanding and creating diagrammatic representations. We explore a new approach to improving student understanding of diagrams that convey 3D relations that is based on students generating their own predictive diagrams. Participants’ comprehension of 3D spatial diagrams was measured in a pre- and post-design where students selected the correct 2D slice through 3D geologic block diagrams. Generating sketches that predicated the internal structure of a model led to greater improvement in diagram understanding than visualizing the interior of the model without sketching, or sketching the model without attempting to predict unseen spatial relations. In addition, we found a positive correlation between sketched diagram accuracy and improvement on the diagram comprehension measure. Results suggest that generating a predictive diagram facilitates students’ abilities to make inferences about spatial relationships in diagrams. Implications for use of sketching in supporting STEM learning are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper human experience and perception of phenomena and relations in space are studied. This focus is in contrast to previous work where space and spatial relations were examined as objective phenomena of the world. This study leads in turn to a goal: to identify models of space that can be used both in cognitive science and in the design and implementation of geographic information systems (GISs). Experiential models of the world are based on sensorimotor and visual experiences with environments, and form in individual minds, as the associated bodies and senses experience their worlds. Formal models consist of axioms expressed in a formal language, together with mathematical rules to infer conclusions from these axioms. In this paper we will review both types of models, considering each to be an abstraction of the same ‘real world’. The review of experiential models is based primarily on recent developments in cognitive science, expounded by Rosch, Johnson, Talmy, and especially Lakoff. In these models it is suggested that perception and cognition are driven by image-schemata and other mental models, often language-based. Cross-cultural variations are admitted and even emphasized. The ways in which people interact with small-scale (‘tabletop’) spaces filled with everyday objects are in sharp contrast to the ways in which they experience geographic (large-scale) spaces during wayfinding and other spatial activities. We then address the issue of the ‘objective’ geometry of geographic space. If objectivity is defined by measurement, this leads to a surveyor's view and a near-Euclidean geometry. These models are then related to issues in the design of GISs. To be implemented on digital computers, geometric concepts and models must be formalized. The idea of a formal geometry of natural language is discussed and some aspects of it are presented. Formalizing the links between cognitive categories and models on the one hand and between geometry and computer representations on the other are key elements in the research agenda.},
